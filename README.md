## **Abstract**

UniCentral is a comprehensive course planning tool designed to empower students to make informed academic decisions. Serving as a one-stop solution, it consolidates course reviews, professor ratings, semester offerings, workload estimations, and peer feedback into a user-friendly platform. This tool enables students to filter and select courses that align with their schedules, time commitments, and academic goals, addressing the challenge of fragmented and unreliable information sources in academic planning.

The project will integrate dynamic frontend and backend technologies to provide a seamless user experience. Key features include a course filter with advanced criteria, professor and course review submission and management, personalized course planners, and social features like peer messaging and discussion boards. UniCentral also incorporates analytics for performance tracking, fostering a deeper understanding of academic progress.

The development process includes:

- Frontend: React-based dynamic components, drag-and-drop functionality, and Chart.js for analytics visualization.
- Backend: Robust APIs for data retrieval and user management, Firebase authentication, and social feature endpoints.
- Integration: Dynamic data syncing between the UI and backend, advanced filtering capabilities, and real-time updates.
- Testing: Comprehensive test suites for core and advanced features, focusing on usability, security, and scalability.

UniCentral not only addresses a real and recurring student need but also serves as a capstone project incorporating frontend development, backend integration, database management, and user authentication. The platform aims to enhance academic planning while fostering collaboration and community among students.
